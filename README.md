# DeepFake Text-To-Speech Windows Tool

Plan:

Application that installs by adding .exe to registry
This allows the application to be appear when right clicking
The executable will be a shell extension implimented in rust
which only appears when right-clicking on highlighted text.

Instead of using default text-to-speech voice, it will utilize different deepfake voice model that will be provided by the user.

Extra Capability: Simple GUI to set voice model dir/ add voices.
